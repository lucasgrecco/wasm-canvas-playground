# Webassembly (WASM) Canvas Playground
This is a small project for a Udemy course. 

If you want to play around with this code, first you need Node.JS installed in your machine and after you can follow these simple instructions.

Inside the project folder, run :
- npm install (or yarn)
- run node server.js
- [localhost:2222](localhost:5000)

To go deeper and make some C code you will need Emscripten, which you can find here:
